Using Virtual Reality, we've created an intuitive environment where clinicians can manipulate and analyze brain activity data in ways previously impossible with traditional 2D displays. While also State of the Art AI seizure detection and sonification algorithms were implemented. Full source Thesis and source code will be available once the project is published.",

This project aims to address this question by creating a LoRA based Carbon Monitoring System that can be deployed in remote locations and send data back to a cloud server. The system is designed to be low cost and low power consuming, making it suitable for remote locations. There was also a requirement to retrofit the existing hardware to allow it to communicate with the new system and with the cloud for monitoring.",
